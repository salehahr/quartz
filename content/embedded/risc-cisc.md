# Computer architectures
or more specifically: instruction set architectures (ISA)

## Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture
* Memory can only be read and stored by using special load/store instructions (`LDR.N`, `STR.N`)
* All data manipulations occur in the registers
* e.g. ARM

## Complex Instruction Set Computer (RISC) architecture
* Operands of the current instruction may be stored in memory
* e.g. x86
