*   Process noise covariance matrix has no clear physical meaning, cannot be deduced from sensor characteristics
*   Leads to non-intuitive, iterative procedures to tune KFs
*   Which means that KF optimality is rarely achieved in practice

Alternative to KF tuning: the use of geometric observers

*   estimates are expresssed only in terms of quantities with clear geometrical meaning

*   If perfect model: $Q$ only describes the covariance of the random process noise
*   Not perfect model, has:
    *   parametric errors (-> parameter identification)
    *   structural erors (error in model structure)
    *   workaround: e.g. choosing from a set of candidate models, etc.
*   If model parameters are to be estimated: (param\_est, Cov\_param\_est)
    *   the covariance of the estimated parameter is often ignored in EKF design

To calculate $Q$ from $C_p$

1.  Set
	$$ \mathbf{p} = \hat{\mathbf{p}} + \delta \mathbf{p}$$ 
2.  Do Taylor series expansion on prediction equation
	$$ \dot{\mathbf{x}}(t)
		= \mathbf{f} \left( \mathbf{x}(t),
				\mathbf{u}(t), \mathbf{\hat{p}} \right)
				+ \mathbf{J}_{\hat{\mathbf{p}}}(t)
					\delta \mathbf{p}  	$$
	$$ \mathbf{J}_{\hat{\mathbf{p}}}(t)
		= \left( \dfrac{\delta \mathbf{f}}{\delta \mathbf{p}} \right)
		_{\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t), \mathbf{\hat{p}} }$$
	
    
3.  Calculate $Q$

$k_Q \geq 1$ (make larger if it plant-model seems very mismatched)

*   $C_p$ is time invariant
*   $Q$ is time-varying as J is time-varying

### What does process noise mean?
Deviation of real system from deterministic system, e.g. due to unforeseen disturbances (human intervention, weather, wind, etc)
$$ \dot{\mathbf{x}} = f(\mathbf{x}) + w $$

No noise is added to $\mathbf{x}$ because the noise is white (0 mean)

### Formula for Q
$$ Q = \mathbb{E} \left[ \mathbf{w} \mathbf{w}^\text{T} \right] $$

*   Important that there is a nonzero process noise or process variance, to avoid the filter becoming a [smug filter](smug-filter.md)
*   A small value for process noise tells the filter that the prediction is very trustworthy, so this will result in a filter estimate that is quite straight (i.e. unnoisy), even though the sensor measurements are themselves very noisy

*   However, as the process variance indicates how much the system changes with time, if it is very low, the filter will be slow to react / won't correctly respond to meaasurements
*   In short: the filter requires the variance to correctly describe the system behaviour in order for it to perform well!

Used in [step 1 (odometry update/prediction step)](SLAM/ekf-1-prediction.md)

Process is assumed to have a gaussian noise proportional to the controls $\Delta x$, $\Delta y$, $\Delta t$.

Process noise $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{3\times 3}$
$$
\begin{aligned}
	Q &= c \cdot \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}
		\Delta x^2 & \cdots\\
		& \Delta y^2& \cdots\\
		&& \Delta t^2
		\end{array} \right]\\
	&= c \cdot \left[ \begin{array}{rrr}
		\Delta x^2 & \Delta x \Delta y & \Delta x \Delta t\\
		\Delta y \Delta x & \Delta y^2 & \Delta y \Delta t\\
		\Delta t \Delta x & \Delta t \Delta y & \Delta t^2
		\end{array} \right]\\
\end{aligned}
$$

## $C$
*   Gaussian sample
*   Representation of how exact the odometry is
*   Set according to the robot odometry performance
    *   e.g. by experiments and then tuning the value

## $W$
$$W = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
	\Delta t \cos \theta
	& \Delta t \sin \theta
	& \Delta \theta
	\end{array}\right]^\text{T}$$
	
$$Q = WCW^\text{T}$$
