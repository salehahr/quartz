*   Process noise covariance matrix has no clear physical meaning, cannot be deduced from sensor characteristics
*   Leads to non-intuitive, iterative procedures to tune KFs
*   Which means that KF optimality is rarely achieved in practice

Alternative to KF tuning: the use of geometric observers

*   estimates are expresssed only in terms of quantities with clear geometrical meaning

*   If perfect model: $Q$ only describes the covariance of the random process noise
*   Not perfect model, has:
    *   parametric errors (-> parameter identification)
    *   structural erors (error in model structure)
    *   workaround: e.g. choosing from a set of candidate models, etc.
*   If model parameters are to be estimated: (param\_est, Cov\_param\_est)
    *   the covariance of the estimated parameter is often ignored in EKF design

To calculate Q from Cp

1.  set: ![unknown_filename.9.png](studienarbeit/_resources/50.2.1_Process_noise_Q_and_W_(odometry).resources/unknown_filename.9.png)

2.  Do Taylor series expansion on prediction equation

3.  Calculate Q

k\_Q >= 1 (make larger if it plant-model seems very mismatched)

*   Cp is time invariant
*   Q is time-varying as J is time-varying

What does process noise mean?

*   Deviation of real system from deterministic system, e.g. due to unforeseen disturbances (human intervention, weather, wind, etc)

No noise is added to x because the noise is white (0 mean)

Formula for Q
 ![unknown_filename.4.png](studienarbeit/_resources/50.2.1_Process_noise_Q_and_W_(odometry).resources/unknown_filename.4.png)

*   Important that there is a nonzero process noise or process variance, to avoid the filter becoming a [smug filter](smug-filter.md)
*   A small value for process noise tells the filter that the prediction is very trustworthy, so this will result in a filter estimate that is quite straight (i.e. unnoisy), even though the sensor measurements are themselves very noisy

*   However, as the process variance indicates how much the system changes with time, if it is very low, the filter will be slow to react / won't correctly respond to meaasurements
*   In short: the filter requires the variance to correctly describe the system behaviour in order for it to perform well!

Process is assumed to have a gaussian noise proportional to the controls deltax, deltay, deltat

C:

*   Gaussian sample
*   Representation of how exact the odometry is
*   Set according to the robot odometry performance
    *   e.g. by experiments and then tuning the value
