* Uses nonlinear optimization
* may potentially achieve higher accuracy due to the capability to limit linearization errors through repeated linearization of the inherently nonlinear problem

    *   to tightly integrate visual measurements with IMU
    *   optimise a joint nonlinear cost function that integrates an IMU error term with the landmark reprojection error in a fully probabilistic manner
    *   real-time operation: old states are marginalized to maintain a bounded-sized optimization window
