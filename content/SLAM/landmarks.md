Features which can easily be re-observed and distinguished from the environment

Characteristics:

*   Re-observable from different positions and angles
*   Unique (i.e. no mix-up with other landmarks)
*   Plentiful -- should not be so few that robot gets lost (robot spends extended time w/o enough visible landmarks)
*   Stationary
