* procedure that can be infinitely repeated
* has a well-defined [sample space](definitions/sample-space.md)
* constituents:
    * $\Omega$: [sample space](definitions/sample-space.md) 
    * $\mathcal{F}$ set of [events](definitions/event.md) $E$
        $$\mathcal{F} = \left\{ E_j \right\} ~ \forall\,j$$
    * $P$: [probability measure function](math/statistics/probability-function.md) that maps events to probabilities (s. [probability mass function](math/statistics/probability-mass-function.md))
        $$P(E) = p_E$$
