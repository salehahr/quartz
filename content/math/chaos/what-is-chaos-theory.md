# What is chaos theory?
A branch of mathematics that deals with nonlinear dynamical systems.
* **System**: a set of interacting components that form a larger whole
* **Nonlinear**: the whole system is something greater than just the additions (superposition) of the effects of the individual parts, due to nonlinear relationships such as
	* feedback
	* multiplicative effects between components
	* ...
* **Dynamical**: the system changes over time based on its current state

Chaotic systems are a subset of nonlinear dynamical systems.
