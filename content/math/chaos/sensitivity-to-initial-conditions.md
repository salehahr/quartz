# Sensitivity to initial conditions
Deterministic systems can exhibit chaotic behaviour if they are highly sensitive to initial conditons.

This **sensitivity to initial conditions** is the hallmark of a chaotic system.

Thus, if a system is described to be deterministic, but without 100% knowledge of the system parameters, this system may well be very unpredictable if it is also a chaotic deterministic system.
