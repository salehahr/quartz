*   relative (interoceptive sensors)
    *   [odometry](definitions/odometry.md)
*   [absolute](sensors/sensors-absolute.md) (exteroceptive sensors)
    *   can be used alongside relative measurement sensors in order to correct odometry drift
    *   beacons
        *   direct measurement instead of integrating, therefore error in position does not grow unbounded
        *   e.g. laser ranger finders, wifi (collect signal strength across field), GPS (bad for indoors)
            *   Lidar, Ultra Wide Band (UWB), Wireless Fidelity, etc \[[Wu](bibliography/wu-2018.md)\]
            *   Compared to these, cameras are flexible and low-cost \[[Wu](bibliography/wu-2018.md)\] (are also passive sensors) \[[Cometlabs](bibliography/cometlabs.md)\]
