*   two cameras separated by a fixed distance (baseline)
*   observations of the position of the same 3D point in both cameras allows depth to be calculated through triangulation (like humans do)
*   depth measurement limited by baseline and resolution
    *   generally, wider baseline -->  better depth estimate (but occupies more physical space)
