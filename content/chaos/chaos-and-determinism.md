# Chaos and determinism
One might think that chaotic systems might have nothing to do with deterministic systems.
* Chaotic systems are described to be 'unpredictable'.
* It is normally assumed that 'deterministic = predictable'.

However, in real life, the information/data of a natural system is never completely availableâ€”we don't know everything about the system, there are modelling errors, etc.

This is at odds with the assumption that one makes when analysing deterministic systems: that all the data of the system is available.

So in science, if a system is described as deterministic, usually almost all information about the system is known.
