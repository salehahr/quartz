# Agenda

## To clarify
* [x] Training data
* [x] Zugang zum Rechner Tuebingen
* [x] Hiwi

----

## Training data
* Did a parameter study for B-COSFIRE filter parameters
* Automated some functions: naming convention, trimming according to video_data.py
* Some training data GRK021, GRK008
* Goal: ca. 3,000 photos, apply transformations to these to get more training data ~10,000

----

## Questions
* Which videos are already 'done', which are more important, in what order to process? -- doesn't matter which, as long as I know which videos I took them from
* Do the images have to be squares? -- No (corrected: s. [2021-11-03](private/minutes/2021-11-03.md))
* Moving circle -- s. GRK008 video (corrected: s. [2021-11-03](private/minutes/2021-11-03.md))
	* Use a small mask & larger crop area? -- Informationsverlust eher besser als unnuetzliche Daten
	* ~~Set custom crop and mask parameters for each video section?~~

## To-do
* [ ] Generate up to 3k training photos
* [x] Install VNC viewer, try to connect to Tuebingen
* [x] Read up on tensorflow - workflow how to train CNN -> bis morgen (Besprechung 3.11.2021 um 10 Uhr)
* [ ] [Hiwi] combine Peter's existing PyQT GUI with PyTorch 3D to enable changing the camera view using mouse -- read Jupyter notebook tutorial, evtl. Visual Code dazu installieren
