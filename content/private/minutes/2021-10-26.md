# 2021-10-26 Kick-off meeting
## Tasks
* [x] Read Regine's documentation, SA thesis
* [x] Generate training data with ground truth (labels) using Regine's code
	* [x] Trim videos to show only relevant sections (where blood vessels are visible) --- (differentiating the situations to be implemented in other work) --- creating function in Python to trim
	* [x] Framework that runs all the functions in one go

## Notes
* Meetings Tuesday 10 a.m.
* Previous work by Regine: not real time --> achieve real time capability by using Unet
* Existing code does:
	* Filter colour photo to black and white
	* Skeletonises the photo
	* Extracts node position from the photo
	* Extracts node attributes
* NN input: 256x256x3 photo
* NN output: 256x256xn, with n channels
	* Channel 1: filtered photo
	* Channel 2: skeletonised photo
	* Channel 3: node position
	* Channel 4: polynomial degree
* Maybe skip
	* Channel 1 (filtered photo) and go to output 2 (skeletonished photo) directly
	* Channel 3 (node pos) to go to polynomial degree directly, because once a nonzero number is in the matrix, it indicates that a node exists at that position!
