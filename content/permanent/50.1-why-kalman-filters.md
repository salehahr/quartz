We work with 2 sources of data:

*   Sensor measurements
*   Our own predictions (based on knowledge of system behaviour)

Sensors are noisy, don't give perfect information

*   Simple solution: to average readings
*   However, this doesn't work when
    *   the sensor is too noisy
    *   data collection not possible

The prediction, however, is also susceptible to noise (the world is noisy, outside/unaccounted for influences).

In short: "Knowledge is uncertain, and we \[must\] alter our beliefs based on the strength of the evidence."

Note: the Kalman filter math is based on an idealised model of the world (errors in sensor measurement are rarely truly Gaussian).

*   Kalman filter equations assume normal distribution of noise
*   Performance is suboptimal if this assumption is not true
