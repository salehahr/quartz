Types of endoscopes

*   Endoscopes can be classified according to their flexibility, thus resulting in 'rigid', 'flexible' and 'semi-rigid' variants.
    *   Video sensor at distal ("away from the surgeon", opposite of proximal) end allows rigid endoscope to be converted to a flexible one solely by mechanical design
    *   Note: the term endoscope in hospital environments typically refers to the flexible variant
*   In rigid endoscopes, an array of rod lenses (lenses which are much longer than their diameter) within a metal tube — also known as a telescope — are used to transmit the images from the [distal end to the proximal end](distal end to the proximal end.md). the name hopkins can be seen on many karl storz endoscopes, in honour of the inventor-of-the-rod-lens-endoscope. [Leiner](studienarbeit/leiner.md)
    *   Use of rod lenses (compared to shorter lenses): enables reduction of f-number, increases optical throughput, reduces vignetting [Leiner](studienarbeit/leiner.md)

*   Flexible endoscopes use fibre optics as the image relay system. [Leiner](studienarbeit/leiner.md)

*   More specialised endoscopes may be referred to by specific names, such as the cystoscope (for scoping bladders).
