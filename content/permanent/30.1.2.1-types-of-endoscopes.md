* Endoscopes can be classified according to their flexibility, thus resulting in 'rigid', 'flexible' and 'semi-rigid' variants.
    *   Video sensor at distal ("away from the surgeon", opposite of proximal) end allows rigid endoscope to be converted to a flexible one solely by mechanical design
    *   **Note**: the term endoscope in hospital environments typically refers to the flexible variant
* More specialised endoscopes may be referred to by specific names, such as the cystoscope (for scoping bladders).

## Rigid endoscopes
*   In rigid endoscopes, an array of rod lenses (lenses which are much longer than their diameter) within a metal tube — also known as a telescope — are used to transmit the images from the [distal end to the proximal end](studienarbeit/distal-and-proximal-ends.md). the name hopkins can be seen on many karl storz endoscopes, in honour of the inventor-of-the-rod-lens-endoscope. [[Leiner](studienarbeit/leiner.md)]
    *   Use of rod lenses (compared to shorter lenses): enables reduction of f-number, increases optical throughput, reduces vignetting [Leiner](studienarbeit/leiner.md)

## Flexible endoscopes
use fibre optics as the image relay system. [Leiner](studienarbeit/leiner.md)
