## Abstract
* Problem: 3D reconstuction has subpar performance when dealing with endoscopic videos, partly due to local [descriptors](studienarbeit/descriptors-in-feature-detection-extraction.md) ...


## Introduction
* Correspondence estimation: match between 2D points in image and corresponding 3D location (s. [registration](studienarbeit/registration.md))
* Correspondence estimation is needed by SfM, SLAM, ...
* SfM + SLAM combination has been shown to be effective for surgical navigation in endoscopy -- simultaneous estimation of
	* sparse 3D structure of the observed scene
	* camera trajectory


### Complementarity of SfM + SLAM
Good camera tracking requires dense 3D reconstruction

SLAM | SfM
--- | ---
good for real time applications | limited to offline estimation (due to the global optimisation used in the bundle adjustment)
usually limited to local optimisation (due to computational constraints) | prioritises high density and accuracy for the sparse 3D structure
prone to drift errors when no loop closure |


### Example
* SfM only pipeline: [COLMAP](studienarbeit/sfm.md)
* SLAM only pipeline: ORB-SLAM


## Challenges for correspondence estimation in endoscopic video
1. Tissue deformation (violates static scene assumption in the pipelines)
2. Textures in endoscopy
	*  often smooth and repetitive
	*  sparse matching with local descriptors are in this case prone to error
	*  possible workarounds:
		*  adding textures
			*  Widya: use of dye to manually texturise the surface (this improves matching performance of the descriptors)
			*  Qiu: project patterns onto the surface
		*  methods to work with texture-scarce surfaces
