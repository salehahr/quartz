## Abstract/Contents

*   overview (classification) of image-based camera localization
*   classification of image-based camera localization approaches
*   techniques, trends
*   only considers 2D cameras
*   focuses on points as features in images (not lines etc)

## Questions

*   [x] What's a metric map -- normal map (with landmarks, normal distances) as opposed to a topological one

## Takeaway

*   Learning SLAM is gaining in popularity, but geometric SLAM is often the chosen method for most applications, as it is more generalisable and at the same time reasonably accurate
*   For reliability and low cost practical applications, multisensor vision-centred fusion is an effective method.
*   Possibly interesting: embedded SLAM algorithms
*   Trend for a practical SLAM system: integrating all possible techniques
    *   e.g. geometric and learning fusion, multi-sensor fusion, multi-feature fusion, feature based and direct approaches fusion
    *   may solve the current challenges of poorly textured scenes, large illumination changes, repetitive textures, highly dynamic motions
