# Bias
* Unbiased: average of predictions is equal to the average of observations
* Zero bias does not mean everything is ok (e.g. could come from a model that was training on too little data) but can be a useful sanity check
* If there is bias in the model, there is a problem
	* e.g. biased training sample?
