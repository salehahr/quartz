Parameters to control the process of learning the model, as opposed to being parameters of the model, which are to be learned.

Subsets:
* model hyperparameters (for model selection), e.g.
	* size of the NN
	* topology of the NN
* algorithm hyperparameters (affect the efficiency of the learning process), e.g.
	* learning rate
	* batch size
