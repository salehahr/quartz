# Generalisation
Balancing a model between underfitting and overfitting.

## Underfitting
Model is not specific enough; fails to accurately predict outputs.

## Overfitting
Model is overly specific, s. [overfitting](ma/overfitting.md).

## Strategies to improve generalisation, avoid overfitting

* [Split the dataset strategically](ma/splitting-dataset.md)
* [Regularisation](ma/regularisation.md) â€” penalise model complexity
