## Outcomes/Discussed
* ~~In progress: testing updated data generator over big dataset~~ --> [removed empty graphs](https://gist.github.com/salehahr/8ee044cbf3db1aecf7554517b7bd987e)  
  s. [project dashboard](https://wandb.ai/salehah/edge_extraction?workspace=user-salehah) for current runs
* Modification to `EdgeNN` network to prevent loss of information due to convolution.  
	![](/unlisted/_img/edge_nn_mod.jpg)  
	* [VGG] Convolving over the element-wise sum of the input tensors
	* [VGG] Concatenating node_pair image with the convolution outputs in the first block
	* [UNet] Use edge pixels, use contracting path for binary classification



## To-do (from last week [2022-02-15](unlisted/minutes/2022-02/2022-02-15.md))
* [ ] **3rd network**:
	* [ ] Batching method (`CombinatorialAdjNN`)
		* [x] **Train `EdgeNN`**
		* [ ] Implement batching/threading logic
* For later/report
	* [ ] Hyperparameter optimisation of `EdgeNN`
	* [ ] 3rd network Adj_vec method (`BruteForceAdjNN`)
	* [ ] Get prediction times on model deployment
	* [ ] Comparison on test dataset
* Low prio
	* [ ] Extraction of edge pixels for data generator
	* [ ] Programmatic implementation of early stopping
	* [ ] Hyperparameter optimisation of second network
	* [ ] Train first network (transfer learning)
