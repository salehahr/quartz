## Agenda

### Thesis
* To start on results part soon

### Hyperparameter optimisation
* normalised epochs
* probably need to get all runs to same epoch (50)
  before comparing
  * several runs stopped early because of early stopping/crashed for some reason

### Found a bug
* optimiser was saved as a model attribute but wasn't actually used in model.compile!

## Notes
* sweeps with `best_val_precision` instead of `val_precision`
* tensorboard profiler to figure out what's causing the runs to slow down around epoch 20
  https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/tensorboard_profiling_keras
    possible quick fix: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64962241/tensorflow-gpu-performance-decreases-each-epoch-on-windows-machine?noredirect=1&lq=1
* outside of sweep
    * 2000 train_imgs_per_epoch, 1000 val_imgs_per_epoch
    * 250 train_steps, 125 val_steps
* in sweep
    * 1000 train_imgs_per_epoch, 500 val_imgs_per_epoch
    * 125 train_steps, 63 val_steps


## To do
* [ ] probability
* [ ] zu untersuchen: effect of batch size on time


## Outcomes
* smoothing of val_precision
* calculate likelihood model probability
    e.g. start with 50% model, then see how likely it is to guess correctly given the data distribution


## To do
* [ ] **Thesis** ([outline](unlisted/thesis-outline.md))
    * [ ] Auswertung
        * [ ] `NodesNN`
            * [ ] Save best models for each variant
            * [ ] Evaluate on test dataset
            * [ ] New metric??
	* [ ] Comparison on test dataset
	* [ ] Get prediction times on model deployment
* Extras/Low prio
	* [ ] Hyperparameter optimisation of `NodesNN`
	* [ ] Train first network (transfer learning)
	* [ ] 3rd network Adj_vec method (`BruteForceAdjNN`), VGG16
	* [ ] Extraction of edge pixels for data generator, train a network to detect the edges pixels
