## Agenda

### Thesis
* To start on results part soon

### Hyperparameter optimisation
* normalised epochs
* probably need to get all runs to same epoch (50)
  before comparing
  * several runs stopped early because of early stopping/crashed for some reason

### Found a bug
* optimiser was saved as a model attribute but wasn't actually used in model.compile!

## Notes
* sweeps with `best_val_precision` instead of `val_precision`
* zu untersuchen: effect of batch size
* tensorboard profiler to figure out what's causing the runs to slow down around epoch 20
