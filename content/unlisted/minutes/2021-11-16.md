# Agenda


## Notes
### MA
* Scrapped translations as a data augmentation option
* Implemented function to sort nodes (left to right, up to down) before graph creation, thus ensuring that the adjacency matrix uses sorted node positions
* Testing suite in `TestGraph` (check if node positions are sorted, check if adj matrix matches photo)
* Testing suite `TestDataGeneration`

### HiWi
2021-11-14 0700 - 1030
* Found example implementation which I could possible adapt  
	https://github.com/yeongjoonJu/Mesh-Viewer-using-pytorch3d  
	haven't been able to run it yet without crashing
* Can't run PyQT stuff in PyCharm  
	* Error message:
		``qt.qpa.screen: QXcbConnection: Could not connect to display 10``
	* Tried: setting DISPLAY=10 in interpreter options (Environment variables)
	* Running basic script `.../sar/yjj/qt.py` from terminal works fine.

## To do
* [ ] Preliminaries
	* [x] Revert to old filter parameters
	* [x] Check adjacency matrix generation
		* [x] Make sure node positions are sorted
		* [x] Make sure the matrix fits the skeletonised picture -- added test
	* [ ] Implement data augmentation for all input and output layers
		* Rotations, flip ok
		* No translations: we want to images to be centred
		* Schwierig oder nicht gut machbar: blurring, stretching, zoom
	* [ ] Function to calculate node neighbours
	* [ ] Function to classify node types (crossing, end, invalid)
	* [ ] Extract sections GRK008 (low prio)
* [ ] Training data generation (up to 3k w/o augmentation)
* [ ] Adjust model -- add more output channels (5: filtered, skeletonised, node positions, neighbours, node types)
* [ ] HiWi (Pytorch 3D + PyQT GUI)
* [x] Model summary -- ca. 30M parameters 
* [x] Make new training data for 256px images (two folders: 256px, 512px)
* [ ] Literature review
* [ ] ~~Figure out model checkpoints~~ still don't get it


## Questions
* Einlesen von Knotenpositionen als Bilddatei?  
	![](_img/2021-11-16-skeleton-and-node-pos.png)
* ~~ID of nodes (how are they generated? random?)~~
