## Notes
### MA
#### Data
* Filter parameters for individual videos
* Preview of processed videos
* Number of data
	* Total for training + validation: 4416 (real) + 4487 (synth)
		```
		ls */[!t]*/graphs/* | wc -l
		ls [!t]*/graphs/* | wc -l
		```
	* For testing: 488 (real) + 0 (synth)
		```
		ls **/test_*/graphs/* | wc -l
		ls test_*/graphs/* | wc -l
		```

#### NN â€” next steps
1. First network  
	RGB --> filtered, skeletonised
1. **Second network**  
	Skeletonised --> Node attributes (PDT)
1. **Third network**  
	Skeleton + node PDT --> (edge detection) --> $A$ matrix
	* Edge detection network
		* Inputs: skeleton, node positions (P), pair selection
		* Output: 0, 1
	* Combine all edges get full adjacency matrix

## To do (from last year) [2021-12-14](unlisted/minutes/2021-12/2021-12-14.md)
### HiWi
* [ ] One pane GUI
* [ ] Docs for Studienarbeit code (Kalman filter)  
* [x] Mask for Farbbilder (json, verwendete Indizes) [link](https://github.com/salehahr/graph-training/commit/c06153e1f89bb6b4c6f7d02f2c128faea3d721ba#diff-e17c319cef82fb313ea8a2c8a3931b3a47f2dcdde2cc83af64a9971f2b581366R131-R158)
	* ![](unlisted/_img/rgb-mask-sample.png)
	* ![](unlisted/_img/rgb-mask-tests.png)


### MA
* [x] [graph-training] debug legacy functions, especially for cleaning of skeletonised images
	* scheint auf einmal ok zu sein...
* [x] How to use Tensorboard to get it to output the data that I want (all in one plot, custom scalars?)
* [x] Data generation
	* [x] Watch more videos and trim away bad sections
	* [x] Adjust filter parameters so that more structures are visible
* [x] Make test set
* [ ] Try out network variants for estimating skel --> node attributes (train with more data)
	1. existing network as is (64f)
	2. simplified network (in UNet structure)
	3. simplified network + more filters near the attribute outputs
* [ ] How much time does it take to predict the attributes from a skeletonised photo?
* [ ] Edge detection network with threading  
	* Look at options for GPU in `tf`
	* e.g. batching (multibatching), methods to solve multiple networks in one step
* [x] [Literature research for dynamic problems](lit-gnn.md) (w.r.t. matrix dimensions)
* [ ] unittests einfuehrung nach Weihnachten
* [x] synth1-6 loeschen

### Other
* [ ] Prepare presentation
	* [ ] Abstract by Jan 7th
	* [ ] Record by Jan 14th
	* [ ] Probevortrag?
* [ ] Prepare for interview

## Outcomes
* For third network, compare 2 Ansaetze:
	* Zero padding (s. NLP -- RaggedTensor) -- try this first, look at TF tutorial
	* Multibatching/threading
	* (too complex: probability distribution for pairing with other pixels as the third dimension of the tensor)
* Filter causes thickening of structures -- lead to wrong pixel position after skeletonising
* First network --> Hiwi
