## Agenda
* [Node Extraction NN](https://wandb.ai/salehah/node_extraction?workspace=user-salehah)
* ~~Unit tests demo~~ --> next week
* W&B demo
* Binary
* Termine naechste Woche

## To-do (from last week [2022-01-04](unlisted/minutes/2022-01/2022-01-04.md))
* [x] Modify U-Net model to be more general
* [ ] **3rd network**:
	* [ ] NLP zero padding tutorial with `RaggedTensor`
* [ ] Programmatic implementation of early stopping
* [ ] Hyperparameter optimisation -- wanb or similar
* [ ] Get prediction times on model deployment

## Notes
* [Cross-validation](cross-validation.md) is not implemented
* $A$ --> binary number
	* Network: skel --> decimal number --> $A$
	* Length of binary number:  
		$$ \text{floor} (\log_2 x) + 1$$

## Outcomes
* Instead of length attribute, angle/orientation is better (doesn't change when a new node is detected in the middle of a path)
* More priority for the threading method
* Threading sub-NN --> [0, 1] --> pixels in edge (helps in fitting for later on)
* Multicultural optimisation (opposing priorities within an optimisation problem)
