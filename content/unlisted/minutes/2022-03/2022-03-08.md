## Agenda
### Data pipeline
![2022-01-18-third-network-pipeline](/unlisted/_img/2022-01-18-third-network-pipeline.jpg)

### Batching/threading logic
![logic](/unlisted/_img/logic.jpg)

## Outcomes
* Use KNN instead of extracting image sections
* KNN for all nodes at once
* Adjust validation DG to reflect real world data


## Notes
* Save and restore in wandb  
  * https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/advanced/save-restore#how-can-i-sync-files-before-the-run-ends  
  * https://wandb.ai/lavanyashukla/save_and_restore/reports/Saving-and-Restoring-Models-with-W-B--Vmlldzo3MDQ3Mw
  * https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/1372#issuecomment-907463675  
    > The `timestamps` will currently always show the first timestamp that the file was created.

## To-do (from last week [2022-03-01](unlisted/minutes/2022-03/2022-03-01.md))
* [ ] **3rd network â€” batching method** (`CombinatorialAdjNN`)

	* [ ] Thesis outline
	* [ ] Hyperparameter optimisation of `EdgeNN`
	* [ ] 3rd network Adj_vec method (`BruteForceAdjNN`)
	* [ ] Get prediction times on model deployment
	* [ ] Comparison on test dataset
