## To-do
### Old
* [ ] Generate up to 3k training photos
* [ ] [Hiwi] combine Peter's existing PyQT GUI with PyTorch 3D to enable changing the camera view using mouse
	* [ ] read Jupyter notebook tutorial
	* [ ] go through PyQT stuff

### New
* [x] Resize images to be smaller, squared, a square of two, e.g. 512 x 512 px
	* To avoid unnecessary padding in the model
	* Avoids the need for resizing within the model
	* Note: if do end up using `tf.image.resize()`, then make sure to do graph extraction (apply `numpy` to get node positions matrix)
* [x] Crop images according to centre of endoscope image (doch nicht so wie gestern [2021-11-02](unlisted/minutes/2021-11/2021-11-02.md))
* [x] Activate Tensorboard (to see if network is converging while training)
	* [x] Tensorboard tutorial
	* [x] --> not working, ask Johannes --> install TensorBoard locally
* [x] Look through the stuff Johannes sent me
	* [x] Folder `03_CNN` in my student folder
	* [x] https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet (simple implementation)
	* [x] https://github.com/karolzak/keras-unet
* [x] In model: adjust the convolution layer dimensions so that it fits the image input size and image output size + channels
* [ ] For later: adjust filter parameters (so that structures are less thick and that it finds some more of the finer structures) and up the Otsu thresholding
* [ ] Extract adjacency matrix and save to be used as labels later

## Notes
* `DataGenerator` for generating batches of images, data augmentation
* `Conv2D` 3x3 is ok, stays as is


## Waiting on
* [x] Model from Johannes
* [x] [Hiwi] PyTorch3d on Tuebingen -- ready on 04.11.2021
