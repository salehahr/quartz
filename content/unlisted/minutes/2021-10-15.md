# 2021-10-15 Vorstellung
Overall localisation project
* Part that deals with localisation and mapping (graph stuff)
* Part that deals with deformation -- using Pytorch 3D

## Pytorch 3D
* 3D ground truth models are expensive
* Idea: generate 3D models (mesh) from 2D data (graph as a texture)
* 
## Localisation using graphs
* Deformation problem: end nodes can appear to change position based on light conditions, bifurcation nodes are not affected
* Use neural network to extract adjacency matrix in real time
* **One problem**: Extraction of adjacency matrix is not robust to changes in matrix dimension, therefore do zero padding (as a partial solution to the problem)

### Idea
* First NN to extract node positions, node attributes such as
	* polynomial degree, coefficients, etc
	* number of connections
* Second NN to extract adjacency matrix between two nodes only (prerequisite: node positions already known, number of connections already known)
* Threading -- a thread can be terminated once the number of adjacencies has been found corresponding to the number of connections
