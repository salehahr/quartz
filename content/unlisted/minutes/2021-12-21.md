## To do (from last week) [2021-12-14](unlisted/minutes/2021-12-14.md)
### HiWi
* [ ] One pane GUI
* [ ] Docs for Studienarbeit code (Kalman filter)  


### MA
* [ ] [graph-training] debug legacy functions, especially for cleaning of skeletonised images
* [ ] How to use Tensorboard to get it to output the data that I want (all in one plot, custom scalars?)
* [ ] Data generation
	* [ ] Watch more videos and trim away bad sections
	* [ ] Adjust filter parameters so that more structures are visible
* [ ] Try out network variants for estimating skel --> node attributes (train with more data)
	1. existing network as is (64f)
	2. simplified network (in UNet structure)
	3. simplified network + more filters near the attribute outputs
* [ ] How much time does it take to predict the attributes from a skeletonised photo?
* [ ] Edge detection network with threading  
	* Look at options for GPU in `tf`
	* e.g. batching (multibatching), methods to solve multiple networks in one step
* [x] Literature research for dynamic problems (w.r.t. matrix dimensions)
