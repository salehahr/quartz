## Agenda
* Fallunterscheidung when updating the adjacencies
* Starting with a large number of neighbours (seems to be better); batch size = num of neighbours
* [ ] To do?: increase threshold for adjacency probabilities
* [ ] End of 


## Current results
### $A$ prediction
Each iteration is over double the previous `num_neighbours`.

| $A$                        |

### Runtime
![](/unlisted/_img/adj_pred_runtime.png)  
These warnings could be due to the variable size of the tensors passed to the functinos.

## Outcomes
* High prio tasks
    * [ ] Thesis
    * [ ] Adjust validation DG (ratio of edges to non-edges), resume training on 16.03
    * [ ] Hyperparameter optimisation
    * [ ] Figure out how to reduce time taken for iterations in combinatorial prediction of $A$
* Lower prio
    * [ ] Brute force prediction of $A$, VGG with `adj_vec` outputs
    * [ ] Prediction of edge paths 


## To-do (from last week [2022-03-08](unlisted/2022-03-08.md))
* [x] 3rd network â€” batching method (`CombinatorialAdjNN`)
* [ ] **Adjust validation DG** (ratio of edges to non-edges), resume training
* [ ] **Thesis**
* [x] [Thesis outline](unlisted/thesis-outline.md)
* [ ] Hyperparameter optimisation of `EdgeNN`
* For later/report
	* [ ] Comparison on test dataset
	* [ ] Get prediction times on model deployment
	* [ ] 3rd network Adj_vec method (`BruteForceAdjNN`)
	* [ ] Extraction of edge pixels for data generator, train a network to detect the edges pixels
* Low prio
	* [ ] Hyperparameter optimisation of `NodesNN`
	* [ ] Train first network (transfer learning)
