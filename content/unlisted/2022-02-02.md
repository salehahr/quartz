## Agenda
* Modified `DataGenerator` -- makes use of `tf.data.Dataset.map` functionality
* Implemented data augmentation for adjacency matrix in graph execution mode  
	~~Checks show that it's not correct yet.~~ [Done](https://github.com/salehahr/tfgraph/issues/2)!
* Currently working on `EdgeExtractionDG` to produce data for training `EdgeNN`
* Unit tests demo
	* test_file_functions
	* https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html
		* Aufbau: [test cases](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#test-cases)
		* [Asserts](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#assert-methods)
	* test_graph
	* CI, ML ops
		* branch with failed test
		* https://mattsegal.dev/devops-academic-research.html
			* Dev Ops: from SW dev -- for shortening development times
		* [DVC channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC37rp97Go-xIX3aNFVHhXfQ/videos)
			* [Intro to CI for ML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BgIDqAzfuA)

## Outcomes
* For training `EdgeNN` -- two options:
	* Only output 0 and 1, path extraction in a separate network
	* Output both adjacency and path simultaneously; the idea is that the path extraction helps with the backpropagation
* Next week: incorporate new graph extraction method and regenerate graph objects
* [Fri 4. Feb] Skip path extraction for now, but find/read up on how it works, s. notes in [2022-02-08](unlisted/2022-02-08.md)


## To-do (from last week [2022-01-25](unlisted/minutes/2022-01/2022-01-25.md))
* [ ] **3rd network**:
	* [x] Updated DataGenerator
	* [ ] Batching method (`CombinatorialAdjNN`)
		* [ ] Train `EdgeNN`
			* [x] DataGenerator containing all possible node combinations for one image
			* [ ] Options for only binary output or both adjacency and path output
		* [ ] Implement batching/threading logic
	* [ ] Adj_vec method (`BruteForceAdjNN`)
* [ ] Programmatic implementation of early stopping
* [ ] Hyperparameter optimisation of second network
* [ ] Get prediction times on model deployment
* [ ] Comparison on test dataset
* [ ] Train first network (transfer learning)
