## Agenda
* `EdgeNN`
    * Hyperparameter optimisation with precision as metric
    * Optimising the decision threshold on test set after training/tuning -- goal: reduce false positives
* Adjacency matrix prediction
    * Auswertung -- MSE$(A_{pred} - A_{true})$
    * Optimised adj_matr prediction times, s. [corresponding run script](https://github.com/salehahr/tfgraph/blob/06731b9/adj_nn_combi.py)  
        ![](/unlisted/_img/A_pred_times.png)  
        * Only the very first run seems problematic (maybe due to first call of `model.__call__`?) -- load CUDA message appears
        * The following prediction runs are much quicker by comparison

### Preview of the predictions in the loop:  
* Starting with 3 neighbours

* Starting with 8 neighbours

## Notes
### Hyperparameter optimisation
* Ueberlegen noch, welche Modellarch.param. sinnvoll
* Training settings so that it doesn't train so long, maybe up to 50 epochs, 1000 images per epoch
* Initial weights to speed up training
* Run on 3 computers, nohup


### Bottleneck at `model.__call__`

> as mentioned above, `predict` shouldn't be used in a loop. Sad things happen if you do. Ideally use model call w/ training=False directly (manually wrapping your model call in a tf.function if needed for performance reasons)

### Improvements to logic
* `remove_conflicting` currently removes all nodes with problems -- maybe better to take highest probability option.
* condition to stop iterating
