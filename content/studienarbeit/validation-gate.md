The Validation gate makes use of the fact that the [EKF](ekf.md) implementation gives a bound on the uncertainty of an observation of a LM

*   Is an observed LM a LM in the database?
*   Check if the observed LM lies within the area of uncertainty
*   Can usually be shown in a graphic (error ellipse)
