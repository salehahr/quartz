Uses a limited number of sparse objects to represent a map
e.g. points, lines

*   Low computation cost because of the sparsity
    *   Map management solutions areÂ  good solutions for current applications [x] What's map management (probably storing maps in databases and recognising an existing map)
*   \[-\] Sensitivity to false data association
