*   Front-end part of the [Visual SLAM Implementation Framework](SLAM/vslam-framework.md)
*   Use most or all of the pixels in each received frame
    *   Provide more information about the environment
*   Many more pixels, require GPUs
*   [Feature-based vs direct SLAM workflow](feature-based-vs-direct-slam-workflow.md)
*   Disadvantages:
    *   Don't handle outliers very well (outliers will be processed and implemented into the final map)
    *   Slower than [feature-based](feature-based.md) variants
*   Aims to minimise photometric error (intensity differences)
