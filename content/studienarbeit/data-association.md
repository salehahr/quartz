Matching observed landmarks from different scans (different time steps) with each other.
Also called 're-observing' landmarks.

Problems that can arise:

*   The landmark(s) might not be observed every time step (bad landmark)
*   Something might be observed as a landmark, but it never appears again (bad landmark)
*   Wrong association of a landmark to a previously seen landmark

Goal: define a suitable data-association policy to minimise the first two problems
Given: database that stores previously seen landmarks (initially empty)
As a rule: a landmark is only considered worthwhile to be used in SLAM once it is seen N times
