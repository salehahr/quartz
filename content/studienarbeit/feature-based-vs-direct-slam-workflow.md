| Feature-based (aka [sparse](studienarbeit/sparse-feature-based-vslam.md)) | direct (aka [dense](studienarbeit/dense-direct-vslam.md)) |
| --- | --- |
| Extraction of features required | No abstraction necessary |
| Aims to minimise error between point location estimate (from odometry) and location based on camera | Tracks objects by minimising photometric error (intensity differences) |
