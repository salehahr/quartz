The greater the h value, the more we trust the rate of change that we can derive from the measurement data.

*   a larger h enables us to react to transient (initial condition dependent) changes more rapidly.
    Because if we have a large difference between our chosen IC and the measurement, this results in a huge residual velocity
    
*   the h term responds to changes in velocity that may not be present in the mathematical model we choose (change in velocity is then 'seen' in the sensor data)
