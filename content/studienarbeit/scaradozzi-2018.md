## Abstract:

*   SLAM's potential in image-guided surgery assuming static environment
*   Review of main techniques in general robotics SLAM
*   Insight into visual SLAM
*   SLAM in surgery

## Chapters
* [what-is-slam](SLAM/what-is-slam.md)
* [Filter-based vs optimisation-based SLAM](filter-based-vs-optimisation-based-slam.md)

<pre></pre>
* [General Kalman Filter](general-kalman-filter.md)
* [General EKF](general-ekf.md)
* [Unscented Kalman Filter](unscented-kalman-filter.md)
* [Information Filter](information-filter.md)

....

## Takeaway

*   EKF is popular in surgery SLAM techniques
*   Deformable environment encumbers precise registration [ ] Â and data fusion
