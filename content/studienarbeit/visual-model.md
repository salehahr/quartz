*   More detailed geometry than that of the [internal model](internal-model.md), hence uses different meshes
*   [Mappings](mappings.md) are used to update the visual model with the deformations taking place
*   Contains rendering parameters

**Libraries for rendering graphics**

*   OGRE (external)
*   Open Scene Graph (external)
*   SOFA's own library based on openGL
