**Author**: Hilary Guite

*   In humans with normal binocular vision, depth perception is obtained using the [parallax](parallax.md) in the two overlapping fields of vision ("binocular disparity")
    *   Each single field of vision has a slightly different view to the other

*   If vision in one eye is impaired, depth perception is still obtainable even with only one eye. Some tricks that the brain uses:
    1.  We know the real size of things
    2.  Using perspective, e.g. parallel lines converging to a perspective point
    3.  Motion parallax (closer objects visually shift much more than distant ones when we move)
