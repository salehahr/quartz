*   Front-end part of the [Visual SLAM Implementation Framework](SLAM/vslam-framework.md)
*   Use only a small selected subset of the pixels in an image frame
*   [Feature maps](feature-maps.md) generated are point clouds --> used to track the camera pose
*   Requires feature extraction and [matching](studienarbeit/feature-matching.md)
*   To minimise: reprojection error (difference between a point's tracked location and where it is expected to be given camera pose estimate)
*   Pose estimation based on [RANSAC](SLAM/ransac.md)
*   A frame with most of its features concentrated in a small area: bad as the features are more likely to overlap
