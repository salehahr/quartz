Initialisation:

1.  Initialise the state of the filter
2.  Initialise the belief in the state

Predict step:

*   Gaussian addition
*   prior = predict(x, process\_model)
*   Incorporate process variance in order to preventÂ [smug filtering](smug-filtering.md)

Update step:

*   Gaussian multiplication
*   likelihood = gaussian(z, sensor\_var)
    x = update(prior, likelihood)
    

The output of both steps is a Gaussian probability distribution N(mean, var)
