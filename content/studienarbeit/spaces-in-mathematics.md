Types of spaces in mathematics

*   Euclidian spaces (3D space, 2D space/Euclidian plane)
*   Linear spaces
*   Topological spaces
*   Hilbert spaces
*   etc.

What is a space?

*   No real definition
*   Made of
    *   selected mathematical objects which are treated as points
    *   selected relationships between these points
*   Points can be
    *   elements of a set
    *   functions
    *   subspaces
*   Isomorphic spaces are considered identical
*   Isomorphism between two spaces: one-to-one mapping between the points, that preserves the relationships between the points
