For the internal deformable mechanics

*   Contains the independent DOFs, mass and physical laws
*   Mechanical behaviour modelled e.g. by FEM
*   Geometry of this model is optimised for the computation of internal forces
    *   usually by using a reduced number of well-shaped tetrahedra
    *   this increases speed and stability
    *   however not accurate enough for [collision detection](http://www.evernote.com/shard/s484/nl/217355218/3d43d987-12c2-40e5-bf8e-6754c868ea4d)
    *   nor is it smooth enough for [visuals](http://www.evernote.com/shard/s484/nl/217355218/8446d918-bc51-46f5-822a-d8405da17ade)
