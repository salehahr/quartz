*   MeshLoader: topology, geometry
*   [MechanicalState](mechanicalstate.md)
*   TetrahedronSetTopologyContainer
    *   tetrahedral connectivity
    *   passed on to other components
*   [Forces](forces.md)
    
*   Mass
    *   DiagonalMass
    *   UniformMass: less accurate, but allows faster computation
*   FixedConstraint: P (cancels displacements)
*   EulerSolver: integration scheme
