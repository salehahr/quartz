We work with 2 sources of data:

*   Sensor measurements
*   Our own predictions (based on knowledge of system behaviour)

Sensors are noisy, don't give perfect information

*   Simple solution: to average readings
*   However, this doesn't work when
    *   the sensor is too noisy
    *   data collection not possible

The prediction, however, is also susceptible to noise (the world is noisy, outside/unaccounted for influences)

In short: "Knowledge is uncertain, and we \[must\] alter our beliefs based on the strength of the evidence."

Keep in mind, though, that the Kalman filter math is based on an idealised model of the world (errors in sensor measurement are rarely truly Gaussian)

*   Kalman filter equations assume normal distribution of noise
*   Performance is suboptimal if this assumption is not true
