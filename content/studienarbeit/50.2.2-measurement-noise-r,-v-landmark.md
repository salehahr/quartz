*   R models the noise in the sensors as a covariance matrix
*   dim(R) = m x m (m: number of sensors)
*   Possible complications
    *   in multisensor systems, the correlation between the sensors might not be clear
    *   sensor noise might not be pure Gaussian

Ways to obtain R

*   Using the variances given in the sensor specifications
*   Comopare the measurements against a strong ground truth and derive the variance variable by variable
*   Record the steady state measurements over a long period of time and measure the variance (look at the histogram)

Increasing R

*   filter is more robust against measurement errors/noise
*   if too large, the measurements have no effect on the filter
*   Kalman gain vanishes, filter becomes open loop
*   if plant is unstable or in case of plant-model mismatch -> possible offset or divergence of the filter states

Used in  [Step 2: Re-observation](step-2-re-observation.md)

*   Noise of range measurement device
*   Assumed to have gaussian noise proportional to the range and bearing

VRV^T, where V = I\_2 (identity matrix)
R = diag(rc, rd)

rc and rd represent the accuracy of the measurement device
e.g.

*   range 1cm variance --> rc = 0.01
    *   A good starting value for rc is 0.01\*range value (i.e. 1% error in range)
*   bearing error 1deg --> bd = 1
    *   A good starting value for bd is 1 (i.e. 1 degree error in measurements)
    *   Error shouldn't be proportional to size of angle
