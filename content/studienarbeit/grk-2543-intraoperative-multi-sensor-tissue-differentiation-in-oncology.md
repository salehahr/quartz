Background: 

*   Cooperation between Uni Tübingen and Uni Stuttgart
*   Gynelogical and urological application scenarios

Aims:

*   Minimise invasiveness and duration of surgical [cancer treatment](cancer-treatment.md), while at the same time maximising effectiveness of the treatment
    *   Minimise damage to surrounding tissue during tumour [resection](resection.md)
    *   Aid decision-making during surgery (intraoperative)
        *   Reliable differentiation between cancerous tissue and the surrounding healthy tissue
        *   Decide whether to preserve tissue or continue with [surgery](surgery.md)
*   Complement existing techniques
    *   Histological
    *   Imaging
    *   Optical (IR, Raman spectroscopy)

Current standard of intraoperative tissue identification: [frozen section diagnostics](frozen-section-diagnostics.md) (takes about 30 minutes)

Means of achieving project goals

*   Multimodal (multitype) sensor fusion to increase gainable knowledge, compared to using separate sensor data
*   Machine learning
*   Model-based analysis
*   Real-time communication
