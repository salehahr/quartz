*   How do we compute the probability of an event given previous information?
    (s. alsoÂ [Frequentist vs Bayesian statistics](math/statistics/frequentist-vs-bayesian.md))
    
*   Formula to compute new information into existing information

Used in the update step of a Bayesian filter
(valid for both probabilities as well as probability distributions)

| B   | Evidence (sensor measurements z) |
| p(A) | Prior |
| p(B\|A) | Likelihood |
| p(A\|B) | Posterior |

In filtering systems, computing p(x|z) is nearly impossible, but computing p(z|x) is fairly straightforward, which then facilitates the computation of p(x|z) via the Bayes' theorem formula.
