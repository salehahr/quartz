Big advantage of using Gaussian distributions (as opposed to discrete ones w/ histogram bins): less data, b/c a Gaussian distribution is represented fully using only two values: the mean and the variance

Limitations of using Gaussian distributions to model the world
i.e. deviations from the central limit theorem

*   Not all situations are describable by Gaussian distributions
    *   e.g. sensors in the real world have fat tails (kurtosis) â€” don't extend to infinity and skew
*   Can't depict any arbitrary probability distributions like in e.g. discrete probability distributions (used by particle filters)

With enough bins, an arbitrary error characteristic \[of a sensor\] can be modelled.
