*   Biopsy: type of medical test in which a cell/tissue sample is extracted in order to detect disease
*   Types of biopsy:
    *   excisional biopsy: removal of entire suspicious area to be diagnosed
    *   incisional biopsy: removal of only samples of the abnormal tissue
    *   needle aspiration biopsy: removal of cells via needle
*   Diagnosing / Pathological examination
    *   to determine whether the abnormality is benign or malignant (classification of the cancer)
    *   to determine how far it has spread
        *   negative margins: no disease found at the edge of specimen
        *   positive margins: disease was found at edge, further excision may be in order
