# Biopsy
type of medical test in which a cell/tissue sample is extracted in order to detect disease

## Types of biopsy:
*   excisional biopsy: removal of entire suspicious area to be diagnosed
*   incisional biopsy: removal of only samples of the abnormal tissue
*   needle aspiration biopsy: removal of cells via needle

## Diagnosing / Pathological examination
*   to determine whether the abnormality is benign or malignant (classification of the cancer)
*   to determine how far it has spread
	*   negative margins: no disease found at the edge of specimen
	*   positive margins: disease was found at edge, further excision may be in order

In bladders: usually done using a  [cystocopy](cystocopy.md)
