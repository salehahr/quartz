**Source**: [rlabbe Kalman/Bayesian filters in Python](rlabbe-kalman_bayesian-filters-in-python.md)

**Initialisation**

1.  Initialise filter state
2.  Initialise belief in the state

**Predict**

1.  Propagate state to the next time step using the system model \[**prediction**\]
2.  Adjust belief to take into account the prediction uncertainty \[**prior**\]

**Update**

1.  Obtain measurement and associated belief about its accuracy
2.  Calculate residual (prior - measurement)
3.  Calculate scaling factor/Kalman gain
4.  Set estimated state to be on the residual line based on the scaling factor
5.  Update the belief in the state based on measurement certainty

Designing the measurement function

*   The measurement function converts a state into a measurement (e.g. for unit conversion)
*   We work in **measurement space** instead of state space because **most measurements aren't invertible**
*   e.g. the state contains the hidden variable 'velocity', but it's not possible to convert a 'position' sensor measurement to a velocity.
