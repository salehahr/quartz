*   Cheap but also with good potential
*   Cameras provide rich information but are relatively cheap
*   [IMU](imu.md)
    *   provides self-motion info, helps recover scale in monocular applications
    *   enables estimation of the direction of gravity --> renders pitch and roll observable

*   Visual-inertial fusion for 3D structure and motion estimation
*   Both cameras and IMUs are cheap, easy to find and complement each other well
*   Camera
    *   exteroceptive sensor
    *   measures, up to a to-be-determined metric scale, appearance and geometrical structure of a 3D scene
*   IMU
    *   interoceptive sensor
    *   makes metric scale of monocular cameras, as well as the direction of gravity, observable

*   Cameras provide rich information of a scene
*   IMU provide odometry
    *   self-motion information and
    *   accurate short-term motion estimates at high frequency

Motivation
Inertial navigation systems (INSs) combine IMU with GPS. However, GPS is not always utilisable (e.g. indoor locations) --> cameras/visual sensors are used as an alternative.
Points in favour of cameras: small size, light-weight, passive sensors that provide rich information at low cost.

Cameras and IMUs are complementary in terms of accuracy and frequency response.

*   An IMU is ideal for tracking over
    *   short periods of time
    *   motions with high dynamic profile
*   A camera is best suited for
    *   state estimation over longer periods of time
    *   smoother motion profiles
