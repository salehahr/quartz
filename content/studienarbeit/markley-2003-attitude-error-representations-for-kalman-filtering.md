Motivation

*   Quaternion as an attitude representation
    *   Good: lowest dimensionality while being a globally nonsingular representation
    *   Not so good: must obey a unit norm constraint

*   In research, various methods for either getting around the norm constraint, or to enforce it
*   Most successful method employs the global attitude as a unit quaternion with a 3-comp attitude error representation

*   MEKF doesn't estimate the quaternion state. Instead, it estimates the 3-comp error, with the quaternion as a reference about which the errors are defined

**Structure of the paper**

*   Attitude representations
*   Alternative quaternion estimation schemes
*   Basic MEKF equations
*   Second order attitude filter
