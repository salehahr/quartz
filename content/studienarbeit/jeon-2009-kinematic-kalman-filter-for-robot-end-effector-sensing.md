Abstract

*   inaccuracies in estimation of EE motion can come from kinematic error (error in parameters in kinematic equations)
    *   to overcome this: take direct measurements e.g. using vision, but vision has high latency
    *   IMUs are used to provide interframe data
*   fuse camera and IMU in a kinematic Kalman filter (KKF) framework.
    Note: uses ESKF
    
*   effect of camera measurement delay, augmenting the KF states to also estimate the time delay
