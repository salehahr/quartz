*   measures acceleration (from accelerometer) and angular velocity (from gyrometer) of sensor at regular intervals
*   measurements are affected by
    *   sensor noise
    *   accelerometer bias
    *   gyrometer bias
*   accelerometer is further affected by gravity --> need to subtract effect of gravity
