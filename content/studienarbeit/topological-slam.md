*   does not need accurate computation of 3D maps
*   represents the environment by connectivity or topology

e.g. Kuipers \[130\] used a hierarchical description of the spatial environment

*   a topological network description mediates between a control and metrical level
*   distinctive places and paths are defined by their properties at the control level
    *   serve as nodes and arcs of the topological model

Decreasing in popularity

*   Topological SLAM has been modified into metric SLAM as [loop detection](http://www.evernote.com/shard/s484/nl/217355218/75ada851-3e4e-88e0-9788-ee8cc5e2f104?title=Loop%20closure%20detection) these years
*   Studies on pure topological SLAM are reducing.
