N means for N dimensions

[Variances are now also combined with covariances](http://www.evernote.com/shard/s484/nl/217355218/4f00112b-f7b3-46f3-84ca-cd033e23a5c2) (to take into account correlation between different dimensions)

*   Variance: how does a population vary amongst themselves?
*   Covariance: how much do two variables change relative to each other?

The correlation helps prediction!

Here: only linear correlation considered; however nonlinear correlations also exist.
