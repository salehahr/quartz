In an arthroscopic procedure (knee?):

*   trocar is inserted into the cannula
*   both are pushed through the skin
*   trocar is replaced by obturator (blunt rod) to open the area up. The trocar isn't used anymore because it is sharp; could cause more damage to the area.
*   cannula is placed in position
*   obturator is removed, arthroscope is inserted
