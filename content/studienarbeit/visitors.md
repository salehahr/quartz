*   For processing of data structure: parent to child
*   Allows decoupling of physical model from simulation algo
    e.g. Easy to replace a time integrator, which wouldn't be the case in a dataflow graph (coupling of data and algo)
    
*   Nodes with multiple parents are traversed only once (pruning of top-down traversals)
