Probability distribution:

*   collection of all possible probabilities for an event
*   the distribution lists  all possible events and the probability of each
*   sum up to 1

Prior probability distribution: probability prior to incorporating any measurements or other information

Joint probability P(x,y):

*   probability of both events happening
*   the multivariate Gaussian distribution is already already a joint probability distribution

Marginal probability:

*   probability of an event happening, without considering the occurrence of other events
*   'projecting' the variances onto the walls
