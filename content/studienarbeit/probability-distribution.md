## Probability distribution
*   collection of all possible probabilities for an event
*   the distribution lists  all possible events and the probability of each
*   sum up to 1

## Prior probability distribution
probability prior to incorporating any measurements or other information

## Joint probability $P(x,y)$:

*   probability of both events happening
*   the multivariate Gaussian distribution is already a joint probability distribution

## Marginal probability $P(x)$:
*   probability of an event happening, without considering the occurrence of other events
*   'projecting' the variances onto the walls
