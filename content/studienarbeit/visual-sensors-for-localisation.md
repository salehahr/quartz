*   Process of determining robot POSE by analysing the associated camera images
*   Use sequential camera image to estimate the distance travelled

Applications: robotics, computer vision

Types

*   [Monocular cameras](monocular-cameras.md)
*   [Stereo cameras](stereo-cameras.md)
*   [RGB-D cameras](rgb-d-cameras.md)

Provide rich visual information, but for that, higher computational cost

Source: [SLAM for Dummies](slam-for-dummies.md)

*   stereo or triclops sytem to measure distance
*   \[+\] possibly more intuitive (bc humans use vision), more info. is contained in a picture compared to to laser/sonar scans
*   \[-\] computation intensive (traditionally, might be less of a problem nowadays), error prone due to changes in light
