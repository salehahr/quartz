*   Position initially known
*   Then robot is repositioned without knowing it
*   Robot has to be able to realise that the initial successful localisation isn't valid any more -- a new global localisation must be carried out
*   Realise this via unplausible sensor measurements (huge contradiction to prev. measurements)
*   Has to do with the measure of robustness of the localisation method carried out
