The update step uses [Bayes' Theorem](bayes'-theorem.md)

*   Produces the posterior by using the likelihood and the prior
*   Also incorporates sensor data (measurements), as the measurements go into the likelihood calculation

Update algorithm

1.  Get a measurement, and associated belief about its accuracy
2.  Compute likelihood from the measurement and the measurement accuracy assumption
3.  Update the posterior using the likelihood and the prior
