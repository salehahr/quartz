The predict step uses the total probability theorem.

*   Computes total probability of multiple possible events
*   Uses the system model (propagates the states from prev. time step \[posterior\] to the next one); prediction
*   Accounts for the uncertainty (kernel) in the prediction: produces a prior
    *   Generalise the uncertainty using a kernel (distributes the uncertainty over a range around the prediction)
    *   Integrate the kernel into the calculations by using convolution \*
    *   Convolving the "current probabilistic estimate" with the "probabilistic estimate of how much we think the position has changed" (from system model)
    *   The prior is a 'degraded' version of the belief
*   i.e., produces a prior from the posterior and kernel

Total probability theorem
"Total probability of an outcome which can be realised via several distinct events."
X\_i^t: X is at position i at time t

P(xi|xj) - Probability of moving from j to i (kernel)
![unknown_filename.png](./_resources/50.2.10.1_Discrete_Bayesian_Filter_Predict_Step.resources/unknown_filename.png) - Probability of being at j at time (t-1)

Is actually a convolution (summing up over all j is the same as doing the calculation for all kernel values
