Scene graph of the internal model

*   Consists of components which are connected to a common scenegraph node (root of the internal model)
*   Each component is responsible for a set of tasks
    Examples: solver, mass, constraints, ...
    
*   Each component can query its parent node to get access to the its sibling components such as [MechanicalState](http://www.evernote.com/shard/s484/nl/217355218/d4586073-9cf7-40f7-9750-a8736a94457f), topology
*   Components are independent of one another â€” modularity
