Initial state estimate x0, P0

*   Filter generally not badly affected by wrong initial state x0, but convergence will be slow if we are way off

*   If P0 too small whereas x0 is way off
    *   the gain K becomes small
    *   filter relies on the model more than on the measurements

Thus: important to have a consistent pair x0, P0
