$A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given $C$
$\Leftrightarrow$ given the knowledge that $C$ occurs,
the knowledge of whether $A$ occurs provides no information whatsoever on the likelihood of $B$ occurring, and vice versa.

## Examples
### Weather and delay
*   Let the two events be the probabilities of persons $A$ and $B$ getting home in time for dinner
*   The third event $C$ is the fact that a snow storm hit the city.
*   While both $A$ and $B$ have a lower probability of getting home in time for dinner, the lower probabilities will still be independent of each other.
    i.e. the knowledge that $A$ is late does not tell you whether $B$ will be late.
*   However, if you have information (other than $C$) that they live in the same neighborhood, use the same transportation, and work at the same place, then the two events are NOT conditionally independent.
    

### Height and vocabulary
Height and vocabulary are independent; but they are conditionally not independent if you add age.
