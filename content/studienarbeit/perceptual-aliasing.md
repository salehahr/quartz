Modeling Perceptual Aliasing in SLAM via Discrete-Continuous Graphical Models \[Lajoie 2018\]
(from the abstract)

*   Phenomenon where different places generate a similar visual footprint
*   Leads to spurious measurements being fed into the SLAM estimator
*   Result: incorrect localisation and map
