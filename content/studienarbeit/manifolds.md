*   Like a surface in $n$-dimensions (hypersurface)
*   An $n$-dim manifold looks like $\mathbb{R}^n$ locally (locally Euclidian)
    *   Circle: 1-dim manifold. If we zoom around a point on the circle, it looks like a line ($\mathbb{R}^1$)
    *   Sphere: 2-dim manifold. Zooming onto a point, it looks like a plane ($\mathbb{R}^2$)

An $n$-dim manifold is a a set $M$ which is locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$

* Homeomorphism: a map $f$ from $M$ to $N$ and its inverse are both continuous
* Smooth map: all partial derivatives of $f$, of all orders, exist and are continuous
* Diffeomorphism: smooth map and with all partial derivatives of $\text{inv}(f)$, of all orders, exist and are continuous

A group that is a differentiable manifold is called a [Lie group](rotations/lie-group-lie-algebra.md).
