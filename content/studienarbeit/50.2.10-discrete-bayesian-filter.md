The Kalman filter is a subset of Bayesian filters

*   Predict and update steps like in the g-h filter
*   Here: error percentages are used to implicitly compute the g and h parameters

Steps

1.  \[Initialise our belief in the state\]
2.  The [predict step](predict-step.md) always degrades our knowledge (belief/prior)
3.  However, in the [update step](update-step.md), we add another measurement. This, will always improve our knowledge regardless of noise, enabling convergence
