## Goal:

*   to scale the up-to-scale surface (output of [NRSfM](studienarbeit/nrsfm.md)) to the proper dimensions
*   get an idea of the proper dimensions from the already estimated map
    *   i.e. resulting surface must match the scale of the template $\mathcal{T}_{k-1}$
    *   $\mathcal{T}_{k-1}$: deformed map generated by the tracker at the instance of KF $=k$ insertion, with shape-at-rest of $\mathcal{S}_{k-1}$ generated from KF: $(k-1)$
*   result: scale-corrected shape-at-rest $\mathcal{S}_k$

## Method:

*   alignment of the map points using Sim(3)
*   Sim(3): basically a transformation that enlarges/shrinks by a certain scale (as far as I understand it). For more info see [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_%28geometry%29-In_Euclidean_space).
    ![unknown_filename.png](./_resources/Surface_alignment_in_DefSLAM.resources/unknown_filename.png) scale $\hat{\mathcal{S}}$ to $\mathcal{S}$
    
*   Minimise the error between transformation of map points in $\hat{\mathcal{S}}$ and the map points in $\mathcal{S}$

    where the arguments are the transformation parameters
    

## Generating of the new template $\mathcal{T}_{k}$ from $\mathcal{S}_k$

*   Use Delaunay triangulation to make a triangular mesh from $\mathcal{S}_k$
*   New map point poses are computed
    *   from the camera observation
    *   by constraining them to be on the surface $\mathcal{S}_k$ (embedding of the re-observed map points)
