According to [MKok 2017](mkok-2017.md), we can either

1.  Use the full state vector

    *   \[+\] knowledge about sensor motion is included in model
    *   \[-\] large state vector
2.  Or the partial state vector, where the inputs are the inertial measurements from the IMU

    *   \[+\] process noise intuitively represents IMU noise.
        This is useful when we have no knowledge about the motion model.
        
    *   \[+\] changes to acceleration and angular velocity will have a slightly faster effect (prediction not dependent on acc/ang.vel model)

The literature for EKF sensor fusion using IMUs mostly implement the latter option with IMU measurements as an input. [Solà 2017](studienarbeit/solà-2017-quaternion-kinematics-for-eskf.md) uses the following states, inputs and perturbations (white Gaussian noise)

in the [IMU kinematic equations](studienarbeit/50.3.2-imu-model-for-kf.md).

Extending the equations to the error state dynamics, the error states are
