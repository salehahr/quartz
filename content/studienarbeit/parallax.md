DEF: The difference in the apparent position of an object viewed from two different positions

*   This difference is given by the angle between the two lines of sight
*   Binocular vision uses parallax in the overlapping fields of vision in order to gain depth perception
*   Distance measurement (i.e. depth from the viewer) via parallax is based on the principle of triangulation (uses trigonom[Monocular depth perception in humans](permanent/10-monocular-depth-perception.md)epth-perception.md)
