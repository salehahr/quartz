*   An EKF propagates the expectation and covariance of the state
*   The MEKF propagates the expectation and the covariance of the error state

*   Previously: orientation is represented by one state
*   Now: orientation is split up into ![unknown_filename.1.png](./_resources/50.5_Error-State_Kalman_Filter.resources/unknown_filename.1.png)
    *   a large signal q\_nom (nominal orientation) and
    *   a small signal (perturbation angle alpha) -- parametrises an error quaternion ![unknown_filename.png](./_resources/50.5_Error-State_Kalman_Filter.resources/unknown_filename.png)
*   This reformulates the error in terms of the group operation and so maintains the rotation invariance
    (rotation preserves the origin, length, angle between two vectors, orientation, etc.)

True state = nominal state (large signal) + error state (small signal)

Some advantages of ESKF

*   Orientation error-state is minimal (same number of parameters as the degrees of freedom)
    *   avoids over-parametrisation, risk of singularity of covariance matrices
    *   lower computational complexity due to the reduced dimension
*   Error-state system always operates close to the origin
    *   far from possible parameter singularities, gimbal lock issues etc. (s. [Which orientation parametrisation to choose?](rotations/20.4-which-orientation-parametrisation.md))
    *   guarantees that the linearisation validity holds at all times
    *   "One interesting common property of the errors is that they have less complex behaviour than the state itself" \[[Source](http://notanymike.github.io/Error-State-Extended-Kalman-Filter/)\] — pose behaviour is highly nonlinear, but the error has a much more linear behaviour
*   Error-state is always small
    *   all second order products are negligible
    *   easy and fast computations of Jacobians
*   Error dynamics are slow
    *   large signal dynamics are computed in the nominal state
    *   perform update/corrections at a slower rate compared to predictions [ ] why is this an advantage?
*   in MEKF: the covariance of the rotation error angles has a transparent physical interpretation  [Markley](bibliography/markley-2014.md)

Stages

1.  [Prediction of nominal states](prediction-of-nominal-states.md)
    *   uses high frequency IMU data
    *   does not consider noise, nor other model inaccuracies, hence it accumulate errors
2.  [Prediction of error states](prediction-of-error-states.md) parallel to above
    *   estimates the above errors, using error state evolution (linear dynamic system, linearised from nominal dynamics)
    *   predicts a Gaussian estimate of the error state
    *   covariance propagation
3.  [ESKF Correction/update stage](eskf-correction_update-stage.md)
    *   arrival of non-IMU measurements renders the errors observable, s. [Observation of the error state](observation-of-the-error-state.md)
    *   calculates a posterior Gaussian estimate of the error state
4.  Apply correction
    *   add the mean of the error state to the nominal state
    *   [Calculation of K and P in ESKF update](calculation of k-and-p-in-eskf-update.md)
    *   [ESKF reset](eskf-reset.md)
