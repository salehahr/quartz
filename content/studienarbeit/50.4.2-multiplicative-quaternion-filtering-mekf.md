Main idea is to use

*   the quaternion as a global rotation representation
*   a three component state vector as the local representation of rotation errors

*   each term (q\_true, delta\_q, q\_est) is a normalised unit quaternion
*   Any of the [rotation error representations](rotation-error-representations.md) can be used to calculate delta\_theta, which is part of the error state of the MEKF.
