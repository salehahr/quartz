The problem with dynamic or non-rigid scenes:
if we project a scene point into a camera image plane, there will be several possible 3D configurations! Allowing arbitrary deformations makes the 3D reconstruction an ill posed problem (underconstrained) &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; need to make additional assumptions about the object or scene (make more constraints)!
