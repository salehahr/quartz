aka frozen section procedure allows rapid analysis of a dissected/resected specimen during the course of surgery the specimen is frozen rapidly and brought to a lab for analysis the results are relayed to the surgeon by intercom benign or malignant when operating on a previously confirmed malignant tissue, information on whether residual cancer was found on the [resection margin](resection margin.</description></item><item><title>Oncology</title><link>https://salehahr.github.io/studienarbeit/oncology/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://salehahr.github.io/studienarbeit/oncology/</guid><description>Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology Backlinks: [GRK 2543: Intraoperative Multi-sensor Tissue Differentiation in Oncology](GRK 2543_ Intraoperative Multi-sensor Tissue Differentiation in Oncology.md)

Biopsy: type of medical test in which a cell/tissue sample is extracted in order to detect disease Types of biopsy: excisional biopsy: removal of entire suspicious area to be diagnosed incisional biopsy: removal of only samples of the abnormal tissue needle aspiration biopsy: removal of cells via needle Diagnosing / Pathological examination to determine whether the abnormality is benign or malignant (classification of the cancer) to determine how far it has spread negative margins: no disease found at the edge of specimen positive margins: disease was found at edge, further excision may be in order In bladders: usually done using a cystocopy</description></item></channel></rss>
