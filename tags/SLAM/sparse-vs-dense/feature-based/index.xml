Uses a limited number of sparse objects to represent a map e.g. points, lines
Low computation cost because of the sparsity Map management solutions are good solutions for current applications What&amp;rsquo;s map management (probably storing maps in databases and recognising an existing map) [-] Sensitivity to false data association</description></item><item><title>Sparse/Feature-based VSLAM</title><link>https://salehahr.github.io/zettelkasten/studienarbeit/sparse-feature-based-vslam/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://salehahr.github.io/zettelkasten/studienarbeit/sparse-feature-based-vslam/</guid><description>Parent: Visual SLAM Implementation Framework , slam_index See also: Feature-based vs direct SLAM workflow Source: [Cometlabs What You Need to Know About SLAM](cometlabs what you-need-to-know-about-slam.md)
Front-end part of the Visual SLAM Implementation Framework Use only a small selected subset of the pixels in an image frame Feature maps generated are point clouds &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; used to track the camera pose Requires feature extraction and matching To minimise: reprojection error (difference between a point&amp;rsquo;s tracked location and where it is expected to be given camera pose estimate) Pose estimation based on RANSAC A frame with most of its features concentrated in a small area: bad as the features are more likely to overlap Sparse</description></item></channel></rss>
