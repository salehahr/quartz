Front-end part of the Visual SLAM Implementation Framework Use most or all of the pixels in each received frame Provide more information about the environment Many more pixels, require GPUs Feature-based vs direct SLAM workflow Disadvantages: Don&amp;rsquo;t handle outliers very well (outliers will be processed and implemented into the final map) Slower than feature-based variants Aims to minimise photometric error (intensity differences) Semi-dense</description></item><item><title>Feature maps</title><link>https://salehahr.github.io/quartz/studienarbeit/feature-maps/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://salehahr.github.io/quartz/studienarbeit/feature-maps/</guid><description>Parents: [Mapping representations in robotics](mapping representations-in-robotics.md), sparse/feature-based-vslam Source: [Cometlabs What You Need to Know About SLAM](cometlabs what you-need-to-know-about-slam.md)
Uses a limited number of sparse objects to represent a map e.g. points, lines
Low computation cost because of the sparsity Map management solutions are good solutions for current applications What&amp;rsquo;s map management (probably storing maps in databases and recognising an existing map) [-] Sensitivity to false data association</description></item><item><title>Geometric metric SLAM</title><link>https://salehahr.github.io/quartz/studienarbeit/geometric-metric-slam/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://salehahr.github.io/quartz/studienarbeit/geometric-metric-slam/</guid><description>Source: [Wu 2018 Image-based camera localization: an overview](wu 2018-image-based-camera-localization_-an-overview.md) Parent: Classification of image-based camera localization approaches Computes 3D maps with accurate mathematical equations

Filter-based SLAM Keyframe -based SLAM (active) Feature-based (keyframe-based feature SLAM) / sparse Direct / dense Grid-based SLAM (mainly deals with laser data, deals only a bit with image data) According to [76] keyframe-based can provide more accurate results compared to filter-based</description></item><item><title>Sparse/Feature-based VSLAM</title><link>https://salehahr.github.io/quartz/studienarbeit/sparse-feature-based-vslam/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://salehahr.github.io/quartz/studienarbeit/sparse-feature-based-vslam/</guid><description>Parent: Visual SLAM Implementation Framework , slam-index See also: Feature-based vs direct SLAM workflow Source: [Cometlabs What You Need to Know About SLAM](cometlabs what you-need-to-know-about-slam.md)
Front-end part of the Visual SLAM Implementation Framework Use only a small selected subset of the pixels in an image frame Feature maps generated are point clouds &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; used to track the camera pose Requires feature extraction and matching To minimise: reprojection error (difference between a point&amp;rsquo;s tracked location and where it is expected to be given camera pose estimate) Pose estimation based on RANSAC A frame with most of its features concentrated in a small area: bad as the features are more likely to overlap Sparse</description></item></channel></rss>
