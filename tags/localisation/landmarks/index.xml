Landmarks that are new are not dealt with until step 3. Delaying the incorporation of new landmarks until the will decrease the computation cost needed for this step the covariance matrix, P, and the system state, X, are smaller by then. Update state vector x and covariance matrix P with new landmarks Add new landmark to state vector X Add new row and column to covariance matrix Covariance for new landmark Robot-landmark covariance</description></item><item><title>Spike landmarks</title><link>https://salehahr.github.io/studienarbeit/spike-landmarks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://salehahr.github.io/studienarbeit/spike-landmarks/</guid><description>Source: SLAM for Dummies Backlinks: Landmark extraction Uses extrema to find landmarks Find values in the range of a laser scan, where two values differ by more than a certain amount (e.g. 0.5 m) This finds big changes in the laser scan Alternatively, using three values next to each other: A, B, C (A - B) + (C - B) yields a value Better for finding spikes as it finds actual spikes Rely on the landscape changing a lot between two laser beams Algo will fail in smooth environments Suitable for indoor environments, however is not robust against envs w/ people people are picked up as spikes as theoretically they are good landmarks (just not stationary!</description></item></channel></rss>
