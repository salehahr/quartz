The prediction is dependent on the previous filter output (i.e. last estimate). Here it is modelled to increase by 1 from the previous estimate.
The estimates are not a straight line, but definitely closer in shape to the ground truth than the measurements alone.</description></item><item><title>Effects of varying g</title><link>https://salehahr.github.io/quartz/studienarbeit/effects-of-varying-g/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://salehahr.github.io/quartz/studienarbeit/effects-of-varying-g/</guid><description>Parent: [Calculating the estimated state in the GH-filter](calculating the-estimated-state-in-the-gh-filter.md) Source: rlabbe Kalman/Bayesian filters in Python The greater the g value, the more we follow the measurements rather than rely on our [model-based] predictions.</description></item><item><title>Effects of varying h</title><link>https://salehahr.github.io/quartz/studienarbeit/effects-of-varying-h/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://salehahr.github.io/quartz/studienarbeit/effects-of-varying-h/</guid><description>Parent Improving the gh-filter by using h Source: rlabbe Kalman/Bayesian filters in Python The greater the h value, the more we trust the rate of change that we can derive from the measurement data.
a larger h enables us to react to transient (initial condition dependent) changes more rapidly. Because if we have a large difference between our chosen IC and the measurement, this results in a huge residual velocity</description></item><item><title>g-h filter or α-β filter</title><link>https://salehahr.github.io/quartz/studienarbeit/g-h-filter-or-%CE%B1-%CE%B2-filter/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://salehahr.github.io/quartz/studienarbeit/g-h-filter-or-%CE%B1-%CE%B2-filter/</guid><description>Source: rlabbe Kalman/Bayesian filters in Python A filter that uses two scaling factors:

We use the sensor information for this! Even if it&amp;rsquo;s noisy, there&amp;rsquo;s information in there somewhere, and data is always better than a guess.</description></item><item><title>Several unwanted effects using gh filters</title><link>https://salehahr.github.io/quartz/studienarbeit/several-unwanted-effects-using-gh-filters/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://salehahr.github.io/quartz/studienarbeit/several-unwanted-effects-using-gh-filters/</guid><description>Parent: g-h filter or α-β filter Source: rlabbe Kalman/Bayesian filters in Python Effect of bad initial conditions: ringing (sinusoidal over- and undershooting before finally settling onto a trajectory) Effect of very noisy data Effect of acceleration (in data) Filter lags behind because it uses a model that assumes constant velocity in each propagation step. Hence, a filter is only as good as the mathematical model used to describe the phenomenon.</description></item></channel></rss>
